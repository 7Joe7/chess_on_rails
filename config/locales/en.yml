# I18n for Investorbridge Error Messages, Humanized-Names for fields, etc..
# Guidelines for use:
#
# Any time code is going to generate a message to be shown to users, it should refer to a key in this file.
#    I18n.t 'the.path.to.the.key'
#
# Any variables to be interpolated into the message should be provided as 
#    I18n.t 'the.path.to.the.key', :VAR1 => @user.name
#
# Caveats:
#   Be wary when defining values with interpolation parameters - by defining one, you require all callers to use it (or they get an Exception)
