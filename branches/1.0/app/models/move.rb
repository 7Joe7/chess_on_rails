# A Move represents what a player did with respect to the pieces on the board in their turn.
# They may have:
# * moved a piece from +from_coord+ to +to_coord+
# * captured a piece at +capture_coord+ (usually but not always equal to +to_coord)
# * castled 
# * promoted a pawn to another piece 
#
# Also stored is the canonical notation for the move, in standard short algebraic form.
# See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation for information on notation and coordinates
