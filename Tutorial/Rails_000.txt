1. The Game tab shows the moves and lets you rewind, forward etc..
2. The Chat tab sends notes, not tied to any move, into a Chat window for both players to see
3. The Notes tab has each player's notes, privately for only them to see.
4. The resign button, curiously placed, has come in handy on more than one occasion !
