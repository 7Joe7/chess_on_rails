1. Dragging an intended move populates a region below with your move translated to algebraic notation for your inspection (it has not been committed yet)
2. This move can be cleared by undoing the move in the move browser, IF you have not yet clicked Execute Move, which is like releasing a piece - it's committed. Facebook chess offers no takebacks once Execute Move has been pressed - you can rewind the view of the game, but not the game itself.
3. On Execute Move (commit_move) you are redirected to your next game
   
   commit_move /algebraic Qb4 /smack "How do you like these apples" /private_note "If bc5, I play Qxc5... " /move_to_next_game 

   commit_move (/algebraic | /from_to) move_spec
               [/smack "trash talk to be shared"]
               [/private_note "private strategy notes"]
               [/show_next_game] 


   Hash of options = command line !! Brilliant !!
