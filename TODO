 - Make sure developer-on-boarding process is simple

Features:
  Notifications (can beat 
  Mobile playability (TODO break this down into minimal steps needed) 
    - Simple streamlined templates
    - Click-click move interface
    - No auto-refresh 
    - Fewer (or no) clicks to get to an active match on which it's your turn
    - Javascript setting of first move coordinate if avail, server reload otherwise
