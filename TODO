Triage for relevant development activities
 - Port any ongoing external games to website
 - Make an effort to get at least one relevant *externally apparent* feature (such as notifications)
 - Check each game through each supported interface
 - Make sure developer-on-boarding process is simple

Enabling for future dev:
 - i18n 
 - MVVM for move/show templates !!! (POJS VM object, scriptaculous? template engine, careful not to do double work w.r.t. RJS)
 - Env.js tests for various browser sim/ JS validation

Features:
  ** Notifications
  ** Persistent login
  Mobile playability (TODO break this down into minimal steps needed) 
    - Simple streamlined templates - DONE
    - Click-click move interface - DONE
    - No auto-refresh 
    - Fewer (or no) clicks to get to an active match on which it's your turn
