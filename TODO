Triage for relevant development activities
 - Port any ongoing external games to website
 - Make an effort to get at least one relevant *externally apparent* feature (such as notifications)
 - Check each game through each supported interface
 - Make sure developer-on-boarding process is simple

Enabling for future dev:
 - bundler
 - i18n 
 - Javascript tests of some sort

User-facing:
 - Start from arbitrary FEN - DONE 
 - Selected piece/cancel move/etc..

Features:
  Mobile playability (TODO break this down into minimal steps needed) 
    - Simple streamlined templates - DONE
    - Click-click move interface - DONE
    - No auto-refresh - DONE
    - Fewer (or no) clicks to get to an active match on which it's your turn

Dreams:
  Make frontend configurable as to which REST backend it talks to :)
