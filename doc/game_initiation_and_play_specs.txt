Move queue
  White: 'e4 [e5, d4, d5, exd5]' (as of move 0)
  Moves are validated as they are saved in the move queue.
  when a move is made(by black), white's (optional) move queue is checked
  A match will pop off the matcher and the following move and play it
     Whites move queue after 1. e4 e5 2. d4   will be [d5, exd5]
  A match is not defined on notation, but on the from/to_coords represented by it
  Up to two move queues can be stored at once.
  A move queue can be edited any time prior to the opponents move.
  Failure of the opponents move to match invalidates (but does not immediately erase) the move queue. The move queue is thus tied to a given move number.
