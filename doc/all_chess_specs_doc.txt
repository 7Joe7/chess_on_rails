Positions
  a1...h8 are valid positions
  a1 rank is :1
  a1 file is :a
  a1 color is :black
  h1 color is :white
  a1 + [1,0]  = b1
  a1 + [0,1]  = a2
  a1 + [-1,0] raises InvalidPositionError

Board
  Layout
    has 8 rows
    has 8 columns
    rank is synonym for row...
    a1 is white
  [Object]
    can iterate positions
    can return piece at a given position

Side
  :black , :white are sides
  opponent returns other side

Initial Position
  assert each pieces position
  assert each blank position  

Board
  The state of a match as of a given move, nominally the set of pieces and where they are
  Validates legality of moves made against it - some rules like Check Rules that require board knowledge

Refreshability
  Should show if opponent hasn't refreshed in a while (meaning they're away ?)  

Move
  is specified by a from and to coordinate
  coordinates must be valid Positions
  the piece on the from coordinate must validate the plausibility of the move for its type
  the capturability rules must be satisfied
  (may be the output of a module that translates notation to moves)
  records the position a piece was captured from
  records the promotion choice (defaulting to Q)

Piece Movement
  General 
    same square not valid move (and must move)
  King 
    can move one in each direction
    cannot move more than one in any direction
  ...

Capturability
  - is summed up nicely by this table
  piece_moving_is_pawn?  Destination_occupied?  piece_opp_color? move_allowed ?
  1                      1                        n/a            N
  n/a                    0                        n/a            Y
  0                      1                        1              Y
  0                      1                        0              N

Legal Moves
  Are those moves allowed by piece motion / capture rules, but excluding those which 
   leave ones king in check 
   consider a bishop pinned against the king by an attacking bishop.
     If the White bishop were to move anywhere but to capture its attacker it 
     would be an illegal move. So the criteria to evaluate is if the move 
     is fully played, is the mover in check at the end of it.

Check
  For a given board (match/move combo), a side is in check if there is a Legal Move
  its opponent can make (excluding placing themselves in check) which would leave 
  the side in question in check. 

Bugs
  upon chatting, clear out the chat text
  chat should scroll to bottom automatically ? 
  always update move queue on refresh (it may have been zeroed out)
